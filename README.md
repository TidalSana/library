# Library App

[Check out this project here](https://tidalsana.github.io/library/)

## Summary

This is my take on the Library Project! Originally I started this project in September of 2021 where I practiced Objects, prototypal inheritance and constructors. However, in the The Odin Project curriculum we come back to implement backend concepts to this app. I went ahead and applied FireBase on the backend which includes Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore. Your typical CRUD Application!

## Things learned

Wow, it was a lot...I have worked on backend programming during my time in college, but that was when I wasn't really serious about programming. Of course now, after switching from a more Network Administration/IT career back to programming, I regret that. Although, I do remember a lot of the concepts from doing PHP and SQL.

At first I did struggle quite a bit when I installed firebase into my project. Getting to refactor my code from plain JS into React was also another milestone. But, using Firebase's Authentication and changing the configs of firebase were very difficult to understand. The Google Firebase Codelab did help a ton and as well as the plethora of documentation available.

Here I connected my front-end code to my backend for the first time in my web developement journey! Awesome right? Here I used firebase and all of its neat features on the app. You could consider it as a CRUD application (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
